"Combining materials in my sculptural work creates a new language that playfully intertwines the craft of paper, fiber and wood. In my work, across mediums, sewing demonstrates strength and utility, despite the activity's implication of delicacy. I want my work to feel whimsical while allowing for deeper signifigance and personal connection."
